this is the code for my website!

it uses libsm64 in rust to make mario work in your browser.
the rendering engine used is the amazing [three-d](https://github.com/asny/three-d) which does all of the heavy lifting for rendering.

## compiling

install [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/).

simply run `trunk build` to get a build in the /dist folder or `trunk serve` to spawn a webserver too.

please refer to the trunk documentation for more command line flags.
